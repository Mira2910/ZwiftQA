				takeAScreenShot method if scenario failed and attach this screenshot to report
	
	utils -->  Here I intitialize my webdriver base on name which comes from configuration.properties file, also I have BrowserMethod class
		   where I implement reusable methods, And I have ConfigurationReader to read properties file.
